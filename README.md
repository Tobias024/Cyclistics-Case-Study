# Data Analytics Portfolio:

### Portfolio 1: 
[**Case Study: CyclisticÂ´s**](https://github.com/Tobias024/Cyclistics-Case-Study/blob/main/Cyclistic%20case%20study.Rmd).\
This analysis is about a company of shareable bicycles. The main goal is to understand the clients behavior in order to take the best data driven actions on how to proceed with marketing campaigns.
In this case I analysed an open dataset of 15M lines with information of trips along 2022.

**What you will find in this document:** A step by step description on the data manipulation and cleaning in R, with the links to datasets, the analysis on Google sheets & Tableau and a google slides presentation with the relevant information and next steps recommendations.
